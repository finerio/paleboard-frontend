# paleboard: a mutual drawing board for therapy

## The idea

paleboard gives therapists a platform to use alongside video-conferncing apps (such as zoom), so they can draw together with a patient on a shared drawing-board

## How to use

With two browser windows, simulating both a therapist and a patient:

1. Open two browser windows and arrange them side by side

2. In both windows, use the link above to visit the app

3. In the left window, log in as a therapist (email: t@t.t, password: z)

4. In the right window, log in as a patient (email: p@p.p, password: z)

5. As therapist, begin a session with Patient 1

6. The mutual drawing-board should be available for drawing

You can also follow the above steps on two different computers.

It's also possible to sign-up and create new therapist and patient accounts, but please note that a therapist can only create a session with a patient that's associated with that therapist (during the patient sign-up process).

## Pages overview

- The homepage asks users to log-in or sign-up
- Corresponding log-in and sign-up pages
- A "create session" page for the therapist
- A "wait for session" page for the patient
- A "session" (drawing board) page for both the therapist and the patient

## Project goals

- Realize a simple yet challenging idea from the ground up, including:
  - Ideation
  - Planning (kanban, user stories)
  - Design (wireframes, data model)
  - Version control (git & github)
- Set up a backend including:
  - Database
  - Routers
  - REST API endpoints
- Integrate previously-unfamiliar technologies:
  - p5.js: drawing canvas
  - socket.io (websockets): real-time notifications between clients
  - tailwindcss: styling

## User stories

- As a user, I want to be able to sign up
- As a user, I want to be able to log in
- As a patient, I want to be informed when i'm waiting for my session to begin
- As a therapist, I want to be able to initiate a session with one of my patients
- As a patient, I want to see what my therapist draws and also draw on the same board as instructed by my therapist
